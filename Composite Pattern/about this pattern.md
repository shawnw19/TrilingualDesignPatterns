### Like the previous Strategy and Observer patterns, the object initialisation of superior class, here, sub-things as in "report" and the list of observers, requires the passing of initialised objects of subordinate classes as it of strategies and observers thereupon.

### I think this time Java did the best job among three using main() to drive the creation of objects and call the instance methods of them. A seemingly length main program is, however, in many cases safer and more readable than a dozen of analogous classes.

### It is worth being noticed that the semantics of loop in Java is shown differently than Ruby and Python in terms of array-like Vector (c.f. annotations in Java codes).
