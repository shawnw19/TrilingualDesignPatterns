### Yes, I think it is a pattern which is ironically too pravailing to be specially treated and is even enshrined in programming language design. 

### In Java implementations of this pattern I included two versions: the first one is adapted from Data Structures in Java by Simon Gray (2007) in which the iterator is adapted and placed into a larger "BasicCollection". It is a rather complex version and today we still learn the design principles of collection framework from it. The second is a nice version of both external and internal iterator http://zetcode.com/java/externalinternaliterator/ in which multithreading is considered (which is rare among tutorials!).

Simple things often comprise great value.
