# TrilingualDesignPatterns
Like many readers, I was attracted by the understandable and comprehensive book Design Patterns in Ruby by Russ Olsen.

This repository is trilingual imprementations of these key design patterns: in Java, Python and Ruby. 

It is a learning repository which contains my own understanding of design patterns and particular features of Java and Python.

The trilingual attempt is intended for deepening the knowledge of all three programming languages in a comparative fashion.
